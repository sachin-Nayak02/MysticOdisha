                <h2>Historical Significance</h2>
                <p>
                    Koraput’s tribal villages are home to ancient communities like the Bonda, Gadaba, and Paraja, whose
                    traditions date back centuries. Living amidst lush hills, these tribes have preserved their unique
                    customs, languages, and animistic beliefs, offering a window into Odisha’s pre-modern past and its
                    rich indigenous heritage.

                <h2>Cultural Highlights</h2>
                <p>
                    The tribal life in Koraput bursts with vibrant dances like the Dhemsa, colorful attire, and elaborate
                    rituals. Weekly haats (markets) showcase their crafts—beadwork, bamboo art, and pottery. Festivals
                    like Parab celebrate harvests and spirits, blending music, dance, and community bonding in a raw,
                    authentic display.

                <h2>Food and Cuisine</h2>
                <p>
                    Tribal cuisine in Koraput is simple yet distinctive, featuring millet-based dishes, forest greens,
                    and smoked meats. Try Mandia (ragi porridge), bamboo shoot curry, or rice beer brewed locally. Their
                    food reflects a deep connection to nature, sourced from the forests and fields they inhabit.

                <p>
                    Visiting tribal markets offers a chance to buy handmade goods—woven baskets, terracotta figurines,
                    and traditional jewelry. These items, crafted with natural materials, carry the essence of tribal
                    ingenuity. Bargaining is minimal; the focus is on fair exchange and supporting their livelihoods.

                <p>
                    Life in Koraput’s tribal villages revolves around nature—mud homes with thatched roofs dot the landscape,
                    surrounded by hills and waterfalls. Their sustainable practices, like shifting cultivation and herbal
                    medicine, highlight a harmonious existence, untouched by urban sprawl, offering visitors a serene retreat.
