                <h2>Historical Significance</h2>
                <p>
                    Sambalpuri Ikat weaving, rooted in western Odisha, dates back centuries, tied to the region’s rural
                    communities. Known as "Bandhakala," this intricate tie-and-dye technique emerged from the Bhulia
                    weavers’ traditions. It reflects Odisha’s cultural depth, blending skill and heritage into every
                    thread, celebrated globally today.

                <h2>Cultural Highlights</h2>
                <p>
                    The craft embodies Odisha’s soul through vibrant patterns inspired by nature—fish, flowers, and
                    conch shells. Woven into sarees, dupattas, and fabrics, Sambalpuri Ikat is a centerpiece in festivals
                    and rituals. Its bold colors and symmetry showcase the weavers’ artistry and cultural storytelling.

                <h2>Techniques and Materials</h2>
                <p>
                    Ikat involves a meticulous process: threads are tied, dyed, and woven to form precise patterns. Using
                    cotton or silk and natural dyes, artisans align warp and weft threads on handlooms. The result is a
                    blurred, feathered edge—a hallmark of Sambalpuri Ikat’s unique aesthetic and craftsmanship.

                    cooperatives or weavers’ homes, witnessing looms in action. Each piece is a labor of love, with prices
